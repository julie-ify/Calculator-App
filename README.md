## Overview
This is a calculator app that calculates the amount to tip a waiter/waitress.


### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

### Built with

### What I learned

What I learned building this app is having more knowledge of Flexbox, CSS Grid and most importantly brushing up my JavaScript skills. 

### Continued development

I will be implementing the Reset button to reset the tip amount and total amount per peron soon

### Useful resources

- [resource 1](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/How-to-format-a-number-with-two-decimals-in-JavaScript) - This is where I got the method `toFixed` which I used to place amounts to 2 decimal places.
- [resource 2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14542062/eventlistener-enter-key) - This is where i got the information to add event listener when user press the 'enter'. key
